# Riak Mesos Framework Director

Due to the nature of Apache Mesos and the potential for Riak nodes to come and
go on a regular basis, client applications using a Mesos based cluster must
be kept up to date on the cluster's current state. Instead of requiring this
intelligence to be built into Riak client libraries, a smart proxy application named
`Director` has been created which can run alongside client applications.

The Director communicates with Zookeeper to keep up to date with Riak cluster changes.
The Director in turn will update it's list of balanced Riak connections.
